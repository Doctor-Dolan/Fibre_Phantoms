# Fibre_Phantoms
A collection of scripts to generate simulated diffusion MR signal from pre-defined anatomical structures


These scripts will produce niftii images of diffusion MR signal that would result from white matter fibres of given geometric structure.
Includes simple modelling for partial volume effects and rician noise.
